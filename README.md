How To Use:

The following shows how import the controllers and use:

1) Add the folder 'MarvelComicsLib' into your to your scripts folder e.g scripts.

3) Inject the module into your main module e.g:

    var myApp = angular.module('myApp', ['MarvelComicsLib'])

4) To use a generated factory in your controller, injection could be as follows : 
 
    myApp.controller('PageCtrl',function($scope,CharactersController) {

    }
